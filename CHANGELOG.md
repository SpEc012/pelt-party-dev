# Changelog

## 1.1.1 — October 6, 2026

- Dive, slide and ragdoll no longer sink into the ground (rotation around the feet, per-frame ground check against the real geometry).
- Real physics ragdoll: rigid body with gravity, spin, bounce and friction colliding on sampled body geometry; arms, legs and head are gravity-driven damped springs. Bodies tumble, skid about 2 m and settle in about 2 seconds in varied poses.


## 1.1.0 — October 6, 2026 — accounts and goals

- Username/password accounts (PBKDF2-SHA256, hashed session tokens, lockout, per-IP sign-up limit) on new `Account` and `Leaderboard` Durable Objects (migration v2).
- Server-owned progress: coins, XP, levels, unlocks, equipped look, lifetime stats; purchases and equips validated on the server.
- Online rooms credit signed-in players from their own results; bot matches are clamped, spaced and capped.
- Daily (3) and weekly (2) challenges, 11 achievements with exclusive hats, daily login streak, level-up coins, global ranks.
- New Account, Challenges and Ranks screens; results show server-confirmed rewards and claimable goals.
- Ragdoll deaths that land flat on the ground, stars, a bounce sound, a "SPLATTED!" death screen with the killer, countdown and tips, and a circling death camera.
- Settings shows the frame rate the browser is actually delivering and how to unlock 144/240 Hz.


## 1.0.0 — October 6, 2026 — the big rework

- **Move set**: 2-charge dive with invulnerability frames, slide (crouch while sprinting), crouch cover, slippery ice; faster run/sprint; knockback on hit.
- **Quick cover**: `Q` builds a curved three-segment wall that rises from the ground, absorbs hits and crumbles; replaces the old 3-ammo fort.
- **Pacing**: faster, flatter throws that keep flying past the aim point, 260 ms throw cooldown, 0.55 s charge, 8 ammo, scoop-anywhere ammo, faster piles, 2.2 s respawn with spawn protection at the safest spawn, a 30-second Blizzard finale.
- **Power pads** show their power and rotate: Triple Toss, Snow Shield, Hot Cocoa, Giga Ball, Sugar Rush (auto-applied on touch).
- **Competitive feedback**: streaks, multi-splats, first splat, shutdown and payback callouts; kill feed, hit markers, damage direction, hit-stop, scoreboard, race bar, minimap, end-of-match awards.
- **Maps**: four authored arenas (Frosty Commons, Maple Street, Pumpkin Patch, Haunted Hollow) with backdrops (skyline, houses, cornfield, crypts) and seasonal dressing; 20% larger for 13+ players.
- **Bots**: target scoring, strafing at range, leading shots, dodge dives, defensive walls, scooping, pickup hunting, unsticking.
- **Renderer**: quality presets, FPS cap or unlimited, render scale, PCF shadows, sky gradient, falling snow/leaves/embers, pelt trails, splat decals, instanced effects; removed full-screen blur filters.
- **UI**: new menu over a live bot match, play setup with map cards, Locker with 3D preview, tabbed Settings, pause menu, lobby, results with awards, XP and levels, phone layouts.
- **Audio**: synthesised seasonal menu and battle music with Blizzard intensity, new sound effects with stereo panning.
- **Content**: 10 chibi looks and 12 hats built on the supplied rig; new dive/slide/scoop/build/charge poses.
- Tests rewritten for the new rules; browser smoke test rewritten for the new UI.
